            <p>This is a website I designed as a school project. This shows a my layout skills and design skills as well. This is not a real company but a fake company used wholly for
                the purpose of creating a business website. This was created with HTML and CSS. You can check the website by clicking <a href="https://rocky-rhinestone-pick.glitch.me/" target="blank">here.</a>

            <h2>Caribbean Vybe</h2>
            <p>This is one of my favorite projects. This is a single page hotel booking app created with React. 
                It showcases a very responsive front-end application with the use of states as well as hooks and conditional rendering. <a href="https://caribbeanvybe.netlify.app/" target="blank">here.</a>
