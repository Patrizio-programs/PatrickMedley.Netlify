            <h2>Dry Oar Rafting</h2>
            <p>This is a website I designed as a school project. This shows a my layout skills and design skills as well. This is not a real company but a fake company used wholly for
                the purpose of creating a business website. You can check the website by clicking <a href="https://rocky-rhinestone-pick.glitch.me/" target="blank">here.</a>

            <h2>Clean-Cut Reviews</h2>
            <p>This is one of my favorite projects. Another idea I had and used for a school project. This project is ongoing and expanding as I look to add more content and refine 
                each page. You can check the website by clicking <a href="https://clean-cutreviews.netlify.app/index.html" target="blank">here.</a>
